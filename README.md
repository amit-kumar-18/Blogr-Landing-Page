# Blogr landing page

![Design preview for the Blogr landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## Getting Started 

This project was scaffolded with Vite.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

With NPM:
### `npm install`

With Yarn:
### `yarn install`

With PNPM:
### `pnpm install`

It installs all the project dependencies.

### Run `npm run dev` to start development server
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

I have used TailwindCSS for this project.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
